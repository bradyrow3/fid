<h2>Our first location originally established in 2001, The Burger Barn has been dedicated to serving good American classics to the Central Florida area for the last 20 years.</h3>

<p>Here at The Burger Barn, we take extreme pride in serving you only the most local and freshest ingredients from our local butchers and farmers. For the burgers, we use a mix of chuck and sirloin from our local grass-fed beef farms to give you a once in a lifetime meat experience. To compliment our beautiful patties, The Burger Barn ensures you have the crispest, and most fresh vegetables by visitng local markets and farms daily. Both of our locations offer outdoor seating, where you are more than welcome to bring your four-legged friends. Bring the whole family for a great time, or just fly solo and enjoy some great vibes, and some even better food. We can't wait to see all of you!
