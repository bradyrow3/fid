<p><strong>New York City food critic Robert Beggers says,</strong> "The Burger Barn provides the Central Florida area with a true gathering spot for all, with many delectable options. The atmosphere was lively, and the service was top-notch. When you visit either of their locations, you need to order the <strong>cheesecake.</strong>"</p>

<p><strong>Chicago critic Les Anderson wrote,</strong>"I didn't expect much from a establishment who shoved their freshness in my face, but I will say how plesantly suprised I was by The Burger Barn. The Burgers were juicy and flavorful, and very well sized especially for the price. I brought my dog with me to sit on the patio, and they even had water bowls outside for the pets. Make sure to get the onion rings, they're <strong>homemade</strong> and delicious."

<p><strong>Los Angeles reviewer Michael Say exclaimed,</strong>"The fam and I were visiting Disney World in Orlando, and stumbled upon this place when my wife wanted to shop on Park Ave. We dined at the Winter Park location, very modern, with a great ambiance. My wife who does not eat meat, ordered the Possible Burger, their meatless option. Acccording to my wife, most meatless burgers tend to be dry, with not much flavor. This fortunately wasn't the case whatsoever, as the patty was dripping with juices and <strong>packed to the brim with flavor and seasoning</strong> that already has her booking a flight back to Orlando as I type this review."
